# How to install the website (hugo)

Only 3 steps u can easily to get start~

U should ensure NPM & Hugo binary [download url](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) before start, hugo binary must end with "**extended**" suffix

```bash
# 0. install npm & hugo if you don't have it

# Note: must download hugo_extend version, example in Linux
wget https://github.do/https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.95.0/hugo_extended_0.95.0_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
# 解压后 hugo 是单二进制文件可直接放 /usr/bin 下
sudo install hugo /usr/bin

# 1. download source code & cd it
git clone -b website https://github.com/hugegraph/hugegraph-doc.git website

# if download slowly or failed, try the proxy url
git clone -b website https://api.mtr.pub/hugegraph/hugegraph-doc.git website # or https://github.do/https://github.com/hugegraph/hugegraph-doc.git

# 2. we need install npm dependencies in project root dir
cd website && npm install

# 3. we could just start hugo server in localhost now (u don't need do anything else)
hugo server

# (optional) if you want modify ip or port, try like this
hugo server -b http://127.0.0.1 -p  80 --bind=0.0.0.0

```

# How to modify the docsy theme

You can find detailed **theme instructions** in the [Docsy user guide][].

1. `config.toml` in the **root dir** is global config
2. `config.toml` in the `./themes/docsy` is theme config
3. `content` dir contains multi language contens (docs/index-html/blog/about/bg-imgage), it's the most important dir

## Troubleshooting

As you run the website locally, you may run into the following error:

```
➜ hugo server

INFO 2021/01/21 21:07:55 Using config file: 
Building sites … INFO 2021/01/21 21:07:55 syncing static files to /

Error: Error building site: TOCSS: failed to transform "scss/main.scss" (text/x-scss): resource "scss/scss/main.scss_9fadf33d895a46083cdd64396b57ef68" not found in file cache
```

This error occurs if you have not installed the extended version of [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases).
